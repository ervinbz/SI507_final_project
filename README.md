# SI507_final_project

My 507 project is FoodFinder, an app designed to help users find videos and restaurants related to their preferred cuisine and location. The app uses Yelp's API and Google's YouTube Data API to provide relevant data to users. 
 
Users are prompted to enter their favorite foods and topics that interest them. The app then uses the YouTube data API to find videos related to the user's preferences. In addition, the app uses the Yelp API to find restaurants that are relevant to a user's preferences in their location. The results are saved in a JSON file for future reference. 
 
When the user runs the application again, they can choose to load previously saved data from the JSON file or retrieve new data. The user is then prompted to select their preferred dish from the available options. The app then displays a list of restaurants associated with the selected meal, from which users can select their favorite restaurant.
